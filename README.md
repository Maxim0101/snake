# snake-game
When I lived in Russia, I once had the chance to play the original snake game which was black and white. 
I wanted to recreate the same game with a few more features. 
During this project I will also learn a lot from PyGame's documentation and implement other code in their documentation.
The main file for this project is the snake.py file. Other files are just images or potentially practice code from PyGame documentation
